## Matchmaking System

### Check-in and Game Formation Process

The tournament follows this workflow:

1. **Player Check-in**
   - Admin initiates check-in with `/checkin_game [timeout]` command
   - A check-in button appears in the tournament channel
   - Players click the button to check in within the time limit (default: 15 minutes)
   - Players who aren't registered will be prompted to register and set preferences
   - Check-in status is tracked until timeout or matchmaking begins

2. **Managing Check-ins**
   - Starting a new check-in will reset the previous check-in pool
   - Players can't remove themselves once checked in (they must notify an admin)
   - There is no direct command to remove a specific player from the check-in pool
   - **Workaround for player removal**:
     - If a player needs to leave after checking in, restart the check-in process
     - Use `/checkin_game` command again with a shorter timeout
     - Have remaining players check in again
   - The `/simulate_volunteers [count]` command can randomly select players to sit out when too many players are checked in

3. **Game Generation**
   - The matchmaking system automatically adapts to the number of players checked in:
     - If exactly 10 players are checked in, a single standard 5v5 game will be generated
     - With more than 10 players, multiple games can be created
     - For example, with 20 players, two separate 5v5 games will be formed
   - Players can volunteer to sit out if the number doesn't divide evenly
   - The system ensures each game is balanced independently
   - Each game receives a unique sequential match ID (match_1, match_2, etc.)
   - Admins can view and manage all active games through the bot interface

The bot uses two matchmaking approaches:

### Standard Matchmaking Logic
- Basic team formation based on player tiers and roles
- Simple balancing of teams based on calculated player performance

### Genetic Algorithm Matchmaking
- Advanced matchmaking using genetic algorithms for optimal team balance
- Considers:
  - **Player Tier**: Ranked tier from Iron to Challenger
  - **Role Preferences**: Player's preferred positions
  - **Manual Tier**: Optional custom tier assignment
  - **Win Rate**: Player's win percentage
- Uses fitness functions to evaluate team balance
- Performs up to 300 generations to find optimal team compositions
- Teams are stored with sequential match IDs (match_1, match_2, etc.)

#### Genetic Matchmaking Workflow

The genetic algorithm matchmaking flow consists of these key steps:

1. **Player Data Preparation**
   - `fetch_player_data()`: Loads player data from database (or test data if unavailable)
   - `calculate_player_tier()`: Converts LoL ranks into numerical tier values
   - `initial_sorting_player()`: Sorts players by tier, rank, and win ratio

2. **Performance Calculation**
   - `calculate_performance()`: Calculates performance metrics for each player
   - Factors in player's tier, manual tier, win rate, and role preferences
   - Creates a `roleBasedPerformance` object for each player containing performance values for each role
   - Applies role preference penalties (each position down from preferred role gets a 5% penalty)

3. **Genetic Algorithm Core**
   - `genetic_algorithm()`: Runs the main evolutionary process
   - Uses adaptive parameters that increase for small player pools
   - Maintains a population of potential team arrangements (chromosomes)
   - Runs for up to 300 generations or stops early if no improvement for 50 generations

4. **Chromosome Representation**
   - Each chromosome is a permutation of player indices
   - First half represents Team 1, second half represents Team 2
   - `decode_chromosome()`: Converts chromosome into two team compositions

5. **Fitness Evaluation**
   - `calculate_fitness()`: Scores each potential team arrangement
   - Balances two objectives:
     - Overall team balance (70% weight): How even are the teams' total skill levels?
     - Role matchup balance (30% weight): How close in skill are players in the same role?

6. **Genetic Operators**
   - `tournament_selection()`: Selects parent chromosomes based on fitness
   - `order_crossover()`: Creates child solutions by combining parts of two parent chromosomes
   - `swap_mutation()`: Introduces random changes to maintain genetic diversity

7. **Role Assignment**
   - `assign_team_roles()`: Assigns optimal roles to each player in a team
   - Prioritizes roles with largest skill differences between players
   - Uses a greedy algorithm to maximize overall team effectiveness
   - Ensures each standard role (top, jungle, mid, bottom, support) is filled exactly once

8. **Results & Storage**
   - `save_matchmaking_results()`: Saves the final teams to the database with a unique match ID
   - Teams are stored with player IDs, team assignments, and a sequential match identifier

#### Performance Metrics & Balancing

The system calculates player performance using:

1. **Base Skill Factor**: Derived from the player's rank (Iron to Challenger)
2. **Role-Specific Performance**: Modified by role preference order
3. **Manual Tier Adjustment**: Admin-assigned tier values can override calculated tiers
4. **Win Rate Influence**: Player's win percentage factors into performance

The fitness function aims to:
- Create teams with similar total performance values
- Match players of similar skill levels in the same role on opposing teams
- Respect player role preferences as much as possible

This advanced genetic algorithm approach consistently produces more balanced teams than random or naive sorting methods, especially for complex situations with varied ranks and specific role preferences.

## Team Display & Announcement

The bot offers multiple ways to display teams:

### Text Display
- Shows team members with their ranks, roles, and assigned positions
- Provides performance metrics and role matchup information
- Available via `/display_teams` command

### Image Generation
- Creates visually appealing team matchup images
- Displays player ranks, names, and role assignments
- Shows head-to-head role matchups
- Available via `/announce_teams` command with format option

### Match Selection
- Dropdown menu to select which match to display/announce
- Supports multiple match IDs from different matchmaking runs

---

##  Google Sheets Integration

The bot can sync player data with Google Sheets:

### Export Features
- Export all player data to Google Sheets
- Choose custom sheet names or use timestamp-based naming
- Access via `/export_players [custom_name]` command

### Import Features
- Import player data from Google Sheets
- Update player information in bulk
- Access via `/import_players [sheet_name]` command

See `google_export.md` for detailed setup instructions.

---

##  Database Structure

The bot uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- **player**: Core player information
- **game**: Player game statistics
- **Matches**: Match information with sequential IDs
- **MVP_Votes**: Player MVP voting records
- **playerGameDetail**: Detailed player game information
- **Counters**: Sequential counters for match IDs
